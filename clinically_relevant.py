Data from MaxQuant contains gene names and protein names.
However, it is difficult to determine if the MaxQuant protein identification matches a protein in a list of
    clinically relevant proteins. This is because the MaxQuant identification may list one protein ('Serum albumin')
    or a list of proteins, ultimately corresponding to the same protein ('Plasma kallikrein;Plasma kallikrein heavy chain;Plasma kallikrein light chain')

This difficulty in matching protein names means a table must be created matching clinically relevant protein names to MaxQuant identifications
We are also able to pair possible gene names with


Two possible data structures exist for this
1) A dictionary mapping clinically relevant protein names to results from MaxQuant. This also contains a map of any gene names that match
    a family of proteins, such as "Alanine aminotransferase", which is a family of proteins
    {
        ["Clinically Relevant Protein Name 1", "MaxQuant Protein 1;MaxQuant Protein 2;MaxQuant Protein 3"]: ["Gene 1", "Gene 2", "Gene 3"],
        ["Clinically Relevant Protein Name 2", "MaxQuant Protein 4"]:                                       ["Gene 4", "Gene 5"],
        ["Clinically Relevant Protein Name 3", "MaxQuant Protein 5;MaxQuant Protein 6"]:                    ["Gene 6", "Gene 7", "Gene 8", "Gene 9"]
    }

2) A dictionary mapping clinically relevant protein names directly to MaxQuant identifications. This has the clinically relevant protein names as
    keys and ANY MaxQuant identifications that match as values. This has the disadvantage of not knowing the corresponding genes, if this is wanted, but it
    would require less work to implement

    The MaxQuant identifications should match any family of clinically relevant protein names
    For example, the clinically relevant protein Immunoglobulin Gamma is a family of immunoglobulin.
    MaxQuant identifies the following:
        - Ig gamma-3 chain C region
        - Ig gamma-2 chain C region
        - Ig gamma-4 chain C region
    Each of these MaxQuant identifications should be paired to the clinically relevant protein IgG

    {
        "Clinically Relevant Protein Name 1": ["MaxQuant Protein 1;MaxQuant Protein 2", "MaxQuant Protein 3"]
        "Clinically Relevant Protein Name 2": ["MaxQuant Protein 4", "MaxQuant Protein 5;MaxQuant Protein 6"]
        "Clinically Relevant Protein Name 3": ["MaxQuant Protein 7"]
    }


With the current data (c18/direct + sdc/urea), all clinically relevant proteins may not be available between these
    data sets. Assuming this is the case, multiple avenues exist:
    (BETTER) 1) Contact MaxQuant support to see if a list is available of ALL protein identifications MaxQuant is capable of
        This would allow us to cross-check with 100% certainty between MaxQuant and the clinically relevant list
    (WORSE)  2) If the protein is not found in the above dictionary, perform a fuzzy search of the MaxQuant protein in question
        If the MaxQuant protein matches one of the clinically relevant protein with a score greater than 80%,
        add it to a "found proteins" list.
        This will run into issues if the MaxQuant protein is found as a subset of the clinically relevant protein
            but the proteins are not a true match

Using this information, we can determine if the clinically relevant protein matches the MaxQuant identification
    This could be done using a dictionary with clinically relevant proteins as keys and MaxQuant identification as values,
    but it would be easier to have the gene information immediately available as well
